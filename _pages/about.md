## Background

I'm an embedded software developer with over 10 years of experience specializing in camera-based color measurement systems using embedded Linux and STM32 microcontrollers.

## Technical Skills

**Embedded Systems:**
- Linux kernel development and device drivers
- STM32 and ARM Cortex-M/A platforms
- Real-time systems (RTOS, PREEMPT_RT)

**Imaging & Computer Vision:**
- Camera sensors and interfaces (MIPI CSI-2, parallel)
- libcamera, V4L2, GStreamer pipelines
- ISP algorithms and optimization
- OpenCV and traditional computer vision

**Programming:**
- C, C++ (primary)
- Git and version control

## Open Source Philosophy

I'm a strong believer in open source and plan to contribute actively to projects that advance embedded imaging technology while sharing knowledge with the community.
